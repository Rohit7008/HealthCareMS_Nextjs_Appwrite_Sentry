#  🩺 CarePulsePMS – Patient Management System


[Live Demo 🚀](https://carepulsepms.vercel.app)

CarePulsePMS is a modern, scalable, and responsive **Patient Management System** built for hospitals, clinics, and individual healthcare providers to streamline appointment scheduling and doctor management — through a clean and intuitive interface.

Built using **Next.js 14**, **Appwrite**, **React Hook Form**, **Zod**, and **Tailwind CSS**, it enables patients to seamlessly book, edit, or cancel appointments, and provides an **admin dashboard** to efficiently manage doctors and appointment statuses.

2. **Appwrite** stores all appointment and doctor data in structured collections.
3. **Admins** access a secure dashboard to manage appointments and doctors.
4. **Forms** are validated using **React Hook Form + Zod**, ensuring great UX and minimal errors.
