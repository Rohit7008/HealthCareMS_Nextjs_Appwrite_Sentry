## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Frontend        | Backend        | Styling      | Tools / Hosting |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Next.js 14      | Appwrite (Database + Functions) | Tailwind CSS | Vercel |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Users select a doctor, choose a date/time, and submit the form.
2. Appointments are saved to Appwrite with associated patient/user data.
3. Appointments can be updated or cancelled.
4. Each action triggers validation, submission, and real-time routing.
